# Introduction

Shoc Platform is a powerful, extensible system designed for running **High Performance Computing (HPC)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** workloads at scale. Whether you're training large-scale AI models or running tightly coupled scientific simulations, Shoc provides the flexibility, performance, and control needed to orchestrate complex computational jobs efficiently.

## What is Shoc Platform?

At its core, Shoc Platform is a job orchestration platform built for modern infrastructure. It simplifies the process of submitting, monitoring, and managing distributed compute jobs across dynamic clustersâ€”whether they're running on bare metal, virtual machines, or in the cloud.

Shoc Platform is tailored for teams and individuals who need to:

- Run GPU-accelerated ML training and inference jobs
- Launch distributed MPI/HPC workloads
- Manage clusters and compute nodes programmatically
- Maintain security and reproducibility across environments

## Core Features

### ML and HPC Job Orchestration

- Define, submit, and monitor jobs using a unified CLI.
- Support for containerized workloads with advanced resource scheduling.
- Monitoring for CPU and memory usage.

### Cluster Management

- Register and manage compute clusters from multiple environments.
- Dynamically allocate jobs to available nodes based on resource availability.
- Node-level metrics: capacity, usage, health, and time-series monitoring.

### Secrets Management

- Store and inject secrets (e.g., API keys, DB passwords) securely into jobs.
- Integrates with environment variable injection and volume mounts.
- Supports encrypted storage and RBAC-based access.

### Image and Registry Support

- Pull images from public and private registries.
- Authenticate against container registries per user or organization.

### Multi-User and Role-Based Access Control

- Namespace isolation for projects and teams.
- Fine-grained access controls for jobs, clusters, secrets, and registries.

## Tooling and Interfaces

- **CLI-first experience** for power users and CI/CD integration.
- **Web UI** for job tracking, cluster status, and user management.
- **REST API** for integrating Shoc with your systems and automation scripts.
