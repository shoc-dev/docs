# Configuration

The Shoc CLI is designed to be flexible, allowing you to manage multiple Shoc Platform deployments, workspaces, and user accounts. This page details how the CLI's configuration works.

---

### Viewing Your Configuration

After initializing the Shoc CLI (as described in the [Installation](/installation) section), you can inspect your current configuration in two ways:

* **Using the CLI:**
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    shoc config view
    ```

* **Directly in the Configuration File:**
    Alternatively, you can view the configuration file directly, located at `~/.shoc/config.yaml`.

### Understanding the Configuration File

The `config.yaml` file is structured into two main sections: `providers` and `contexts`.

#### Providers

The `providers` section defines the Shoc Platform servers that your CLI interacts with. By default, when you initialize your configuration, it includes one provider named `global` which points to the public Shoc Platform deployment. However, you can add definitions for multiple private Shoc Platform deployments if needed.

Here's an example of a provider definition:

```yaml
providers:
  # A friendly name of the configured provider (defaults to 'global' for shoc.dev)
  - name: global
    # Root URL to the platform itself
    url: https://shoc.dev
    # The URL to the Shoc Platform API
    api: https://api.shoc.dev
    # URL to Shoc's SSO
    identity: https://identity.shoc.dev
```

#### Contexts

The `contexts` section allows you to manage multi-provider, multi-workspace, and multi-user scenarios, similar to how Kubernetes handles `kubeconfig`. Each context defines a specific configuration for interacting with Shoc Platform.

Here's an example of a context definition:

```yaml
contexts:
  # The name of the context (default value used is "default")
  - name: default 
    # Refers to a concrete provider defined in the 'providers' section
    provider: global 
    # The default workspace to use within this context
    workspace: my-workspace 
```

**Important Note on Credentials:**
Sensitive credentials, such as API tokens, are never stored directly in the `config.yaml` file. Instead, they are securely stored in your operating system's secure password storage (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux `libsecret`).

### Using Multiple Contexts and Workspaces

The Shoc CLI provides flags to easily switch between different contexts or workspaces for specific commands without modifying your default configuration:

* **Using a Different Context:**
    To execute a command using a different context, use the `-c` or `--context` flag:
    ```bash
    shoc -c my-context jobs
    ```

* **Using a Different Workspace within a Context:**
    To execute a command using a different workspace within your current or specified context, use the `-w` or `--workspace` flag:
    ```bash
    shoc -w my-other-workspace jobs
    ```
