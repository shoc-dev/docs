# Jobs

This page describes how to define, build, and run computational jobs on a cluster registered with Shoc Platform. To follow these steps, ensure you have the [Shoc CLI](/installation) installed and a [cluster](/clusters) already configured in your workspace.

### Package Creation: Building Container Images from Code

Shoc Platform streamlines the process of preparing your code for execution by automatically making container images. This involves a **building** phase where your code is transformed into a deployable **Package**.

#### The Building Phase

The building process is initiated by providing your code along with a special manifest file named `build.shoc.yaml`. During the build:

1.  Your code and the `build.shoc.yaml` manifest are uploaded to the Shoc Platform server.
2.  The platform then builds a target container image based on your specifications.
3.  This newly built image is securely stored in Shoc Platform's built-in container registry.

The resulting artifact of a successful build is called a **Package**. A Package is an immutable, versioned container image ready to be deployed and run on any compatible cluster.

#### Defining Your Build with `build.shoc.yaml`

To build a Package, you must provide a `build.shoc.yaml` file that specifies how your code should be containerized. These manifest files are based on existing templates, which define the base image and common build behaviors.

You can explore available templates and their variants at: [https://shoc.dev/templates](https://shoc.dev/templates)

Let's consider a simple example: You have a project folder `my-project` containing a shell script named `entrypoint.sh`. This script will simply print some system information:

**`my-project/entrypoint.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello from Shoc Platform!"
echo "Running on hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
echo "User: $(whoami)"
echo "OS: $(cat /etc/os-release | grep PRETTY_NAME | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d '"')"
```

To containerize this script using a lightweight Alpine Linux base, you would create a `build.shoc.yaml` file in the same `my-project` directory:

**`my-project/build.shoc.yaml`**
```yaml
template: alpine:default
spec:
  entrypoint: ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

* `template: alpine:default` specifies that this build should use the `default` variant of the `alpine` template. This template provides a minimal Alpine Linux base image.
* `spec.entrypoint` defines the command that will be executed when the container starts. Here, it's set to run your `entrypoint.sh` script.

More detailed options for configuring your `build.shoc.yaml` can be found in the documentation for each specific template and its variants. For our `alpine:default` example, you can find more information here: [https://shoc.dev/templates/alpine/variants/default](https://shoc.dev/templates/alpine/variants/default)

#### Building the Package

Once your `my-project` folder contains both `build.shoc.yaml` and `entrypoint.sh`, navigate into that folder in your terminal and execute the build command:

```bash
cd my-project
shoc build
```

If the build process is successful, you will receive a success message, and your Package will be ready for submission.

### Running Jobs

After a Package has been built, you can submit it to a registered cluster as a Job. Shoc Platform supports two primary runtime types for jobs, determined by the Package's template:

* **`function`**: Used for simple, single-node tasks that don't require inter-process communication across multiple nodes. Our `alpine:default` example creates a Package with a `function` runtime.
* **`mpi`**: Designed for tasks that are distributed using an MPI backend (e.g., OpenMPI, MPICH), requiring multi-node coordination.

#### Submitting a Job with a Run Manifest

To run a Job, you typically define another manifest file, `run.shoc.yaml`, in your project directory. This manifest specifies runtime parameters for your job, such as the target cluster.

For our example, a simple `run.shoc.yaml` might look like this:

**`my-project/run.shoc.yaml`**
```yaml
cluster: my-cluster
```

* `cluster: my-cluster` specifies that this job should be submitted to the cluster named `my-cluster` (assuming you have a cluster with that name configured in your workspace).

#### Executing the Run Command

With your `run.shoc.yaml` file in place, execute the run command from your project folder:

```bash
cd my-project
shoc run
```

When you run `shoc run`:
* The CLI will first check if a Package has already been built for your project. If a valid, cached version exists, it will use that.
* If no Package exists or the local code has changed, it will automatically trigger a `shoc build` operation before proceeding.
* Finally, a Job will be submitted to the specified cluster (`my-cluster` in this example).

#### Tasks

By default, Shoc Platform jobs are designed as **task arrays**. This powerful feature allows a single Shoc Job definition to run multiple, similar tasks of the same Package. This is particularly useful for parallelizing workloads where each task performs a part of a larger job, much like job arrays found in traditional HPC schedulers like Slurm.
