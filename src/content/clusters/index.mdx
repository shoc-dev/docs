# Clusters

Shoc Platform is designed to orchestrate your computational workloads across multiple compute clusters. Currently, Shoc Platform primarily supports **self-provisioned Kubernetes clusters**. This means that before you can integrate a cluster with Shoc Platform, you must have a Kubernetes cluster already up and running and accessible.

---

### Attaching a New Cluster (Web UI)

Once your Kubernetes cluster is ready, you can easily attach it to your Shoc Platform workspace via the web user interface:

1.  Navigate to your desired workspace by going to **Workspace > `[your-workspace-name]`**.
2.  From the left-hand navigation, select the **Clusters** page.
3.  Click the "Add" or "Attach Cluster" button to open the configuration form.
4.  You will need to provide the following details:
    * **Name**: A unique, friendly name to identify this cluster within your workspace (e.g., `my-dev-cluster`, `gpu-cluster-us-east`).
    * **Description**: An optional field where you can provide a brief description of the cluster, its purpose, or its specifications.
    * **Type**: Select `Kubernetes`. This is the only cluster type currently supported for self-provisioned clusters.
    * **Configuration**: For Kubernetes clusters, you must paste the **full content of your Kubeconfig file** into this field. This `kubeconfig` provides Shoc Platform with the necessary credentials and connection details to access and manage your cluster.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”’">
**Secure Storage of Credentials:**
Please be assured that your Kubeconfig and any other relevant sensitive credentials provided during cluster configuration are securely stored server-side in an encrypted form. They are never exposed directly after submission.
</Callout>

### Monitoring Cluster Status

After successfully adding a cluster, you can monitor its status and details from its dedicated page:

1.  Navigate to **Workspace > `[your-workspace-name]` > Clusters**.
2.  Click on the name of the cluster you just added (e.g., `my-cluster`).

On the cluster's detail page, you will see:
* **Connectivity Status**: An indication of whether Shoc Platform can successfully connect to your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Cluster Information**: Once a connection is established, you will see details about your cluster, such as available resources (CPU, Memory, GPU), a list of connected nodes, and their respective statuses.

An "Online" status indicates that Shoc Platform has a stable connection to your cluster and it is ready to accept and run your jobs.

### Reconfiguring a Cluster

Should you need to update your cluster's configuration (e.g., if your `kubeconfig` changes or you want to update its description), you can do so from the cluster's dashboard:

1.  Go to the specific cluster's detail page (**Workspace > `[your-workspace-name]` > Clusters > `[your-cluster-name]`**).
2.  Look for the **Actions** menu (often represented by an ellipsis `...` or a gear icon).
3.  Select **Configure** to open the configuration editor and make the necessary adjustments.

### Listing Clusters (CLI)

You can also view your attached clusters directly from the Shoc CLI:

To list all clusters configured within your current workspace, run:

```bash
shoc clusters list
```
